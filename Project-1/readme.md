Project Overview
The objective of this project is to create a system that can classify images into two categories:

With Mask
Without Mask
The solution involves:

Preprocessing an image dataset.
Building and training a CNN-based model.
Evaluating the model's performance.
Using the model for predictions on new images.
Dataset Description
The dataset used is the Face Mask Dataset, available on Kaggle. It consists of labeled images in two categories:

With Mask: Images of individuals wearing face masks.
Without Mask: Images of individuals not wearing face masks.
Data Summary
Number of Images:
With Mask: 3,725
Without Mask: 3,828
Image Dimensions: Resized to 128x128 pixels for uniformity.
Labels
1: With Mask
0: Without Mask
Model Details
The predictive model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is highly effective for image classification tasks.

Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

Resizing images to 128x128.
Converting images to RGB format.
Normalizing pixel values (scaling between 0 and 1).
Model Architecture:

Convolutional Layers with ReLU activation.
MaxPooling Layers for down-sampling.
Fully Connected Dense Layers.
Dropout for regularization.
Output Layer with Sigmoid activation for binary classification.
Compilation:

Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy.
Optimizer: Adam.
Evaluation Metric: Accuracy.
Training:

80-20 train-test split.
Validation split of 10% from the training data.
Model trained for 5 epochs.
